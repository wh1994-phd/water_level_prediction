# Project Name

WaterLevelPredictionToolkit

## Project Overview

This project aims to comprehensively consider water level prediction methods from both the time series and hydrology fields and conduct fair comparisons on public datasets. By integrating advanced algorithms from different domains, we hope to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and efficient tool for water level prediction.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Integration**: Includes the latest methods from time series models and hydrological models.
- **Fair Evaluation**: Conducts fair comparisons of methods on unified public datasets.
- **Modular Design**: Clear code structure for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Visualization Support**: Provides visualization tools for prediction results for analysis and presentation.

## Current Progress

Currently, we only provide the inference part of the method from our paper. All subsequent code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation modules, will be gradually uploaded after being reviewed. Please stay tuned to this repository for the latest updates.


## Datasets

This project uses the following public datasets:
